CodePrep Labs is a collection of code examples and tutorials designed to help developers learn new concepts through practical, hands-on examples. It's a GitHub organization with 35+ repositories covering various Java technologies and frameworks.

### What it includes

- **Design Patterns** - Real-world examples of various design patterns
- **Modern Java** - Features from Java 8 to the latest versions
- **Multithreading** - Comprehensive Java concurrency examples
- **Spring Framework** - Tutorials on Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring IOC
- **Kafka & Messaging** - Apache Kafka integration examples
- **Database Technologies** - Hibernate 5.4.x and Elasticsearch tutorials
- **Modern Frameworks** - Micronaut framework examples

### Why I built it

I wanted to create a centralized resource where developers can find working code examples and learn by doing. Rather than just reading documentation, learners can clone, run, and modify real examples to understand how different technologies work.

### Highlights

- 35+ repositories covering different Java technologies
- All code is MIT or Apache-2.0 licensed (free to use)
- Based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India
- Focuses on practical, runnable examples
- Active maintenance with recent updates

### Technologies covered

- Java (primary focus, from Java 8 onwards)
- Spring Framework (Boot, MVC, IOC, Security)
- Apache Kafka
- Elasticsearch
- Hibernate ORM
- Micronaut
- Design Patterns & Best Practices

### Architecture approach

CodePrep Labs follows a simple, modular learning structure:

- Each repository focuses on **one technology or concept**
- **Self-contained examples** that can run independently
- Clear separation of concerns in tutorial organization
- Progressive learning path from basics to advanced topics

The repositories are organized by technology instead of by project, making it easy for learners to find exactly what they need.
