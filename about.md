Hi, I’m Praveen.

I'm a software developer with over 13+ years of experience building web-based, client-server, and distributed applications. I hold a Master's degree in Data Science and Machine Learning, which complements my practical expertise in building intelligent software systems. 

Currently, I work as a Senior Technical Lead at [Happiest Minds Technologies Pvt Ltd](http://www.happiestminds.com/), where I design and develop scalable backend systems and modern web solutions.

I specialize in Java and open-source frameworks such as Spring, Micronaut, Netflix DGS (GraphQL), JPA, and Hibernate. On the frontend side, I’m proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React, enabling me to deliver full-stack solutions end-to-end.

Beyond professional work, I have a strong passion for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and I actively explore how these technologies can shape the future of software development.

I also share my projects, experiments, and learnings on my blog. 

For more details about my work and experience, you can check out my [resume](https://github.com/thejavamonk/thejavamonk.github.io/raw/master/resources/PraveenKumar.pdf).
